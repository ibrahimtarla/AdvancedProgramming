                  Restructuring is the arrangements made in favor of the debtor on the existing debt amount or payment
                  plan in case the debtor falls into difficulty or impossibility of payment, either before official
                  institutions or informally by mutual negotiation directly with creditors. The central issues of the
                  restructuring process can be summarized as strategic evaluation, capital improvement, cost reduction,
                  acquisition and financial, legal risk and opportunity analysis.
