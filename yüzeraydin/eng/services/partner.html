          entrepreneurshipTo establish strategic alliances with domestic or foreign investors and companies for their
          activities, joint businesstends to do. For the purpose of doing joint business, Companies combine their
          knowledge and capital to create a commoncoming together for economic purposes and a partnership structure
          under the name of "Joint Venture" in international parlancethey are composing. Joint Investment Ventures or
          Joint as it is used in international commercial lifeVenture; the partner agreed by more than one legal entity
          coming together and acting togetherIt can be defined as a business structure. Joint Venture in legal
          terminology; "Legally anda specific business or continuity of more than one real or legal person who is
          independent of each other from each otherby establishing or without a trading partnership.to come together
          within the framework of a contract for the purpose of realizing and obtaining profit, and that activityassume
          their risk by each of them taking on mutual responsibility."Defined.The terms "Joint Venture" and "Consortium"
          should not be confused. ConsortiumAs in Joint Venture, it was born out of the need to be able to carry out
          large volume and diameter works. Peoplecome together for the purpose of performing a specific job or tasks
          together, and each of themtake responsibility for the performance of only part of the work, independent of
          othersin the case of a "consortium".It is important that the Joint Venture is not confused with the

          time and at low cost, and getting ahead in the competitionthey adopt this partnership model in order to be
          able to do so.The biggest disadvantage foreseen for Joint Venture is; its application is mostly in a very
          unknown region, oris that the risk level is quite high because it is aimed at the sector. For these reasons,
          Joint VentureIn order for preparatory projects to succeed, the risk level in both domestic and international
          processesmaximum care should be taken to minimize it. Not only legislation and international customs; goalThe
